start with mask0.ttl
--> create onlySuave02 (generation 0)
use test cases onlySuave02 to develop mask1
--> create onlySuave03 (generation 1) --> all passed
--> create onlySuave04 (generation 2)
use test cases to develop mask2 (not fully correct, as not possible)
--> create onlyGeneric03 (generation 3)
use test cases to develop mask3
--> create onlySuave05 (generation 4)
use test cases to develop mask4 + forbid "AddQAEstimationMutation", as this leads to problems (in some cases)
--> create onlySuave06 (generation 5)
use test cases to develop mask5
--> create onlySuave07 (generation 6)
use test cases to develop mask6 (already quite some over-approximation, but unavoidable...)
--> create onlySuave08 (generation 7)
